CREATIVE-MINDED SOFTWARE DEVELOPER in training at Masterschool, specializing in AI and software engineering. With an M.A. in Journalism and a decade-long background in music, photography, and visual storytelling, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, creativity, and curiosity to everything I do.

After years touring internationally as a photographer and tour manager—coordinating global teams and capturing narrative-driven visuals—the pandemic opened space for deeper creative exploration and reflection. As AI emerged in creative workflows, my curiosity in tech grew naturally. This led me to pursue a full-time training in Software Engineering with a specialisation in AI, focusing on developing and deploying AI-driven applications.

Skills I’m building amongst others:

-> Python (application development, data workflows)

-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Software Architecture

-> Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

-> Backend Development: FastAPI

-> Databases & SQL

-> AI / LLM Workflows: Prompt Engineering, RAG, LangChain

-> Model Tools: HuggingFace Ecosystem

------------------------------------------------------

What drives me:

-> Merging creative + technical skills to build mindful and purpose-driven tools

-> Lifelong learning with a growth mindset (and every mistakes is a step forward!)

-> Creating, connecting, and contributing with purpose and independence

Empowering myself through mindfulness, climbing and the creative process.

Approaching work with awareness, intention, and empathy.

Guided by values, not just goals.
