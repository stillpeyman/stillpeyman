🎓 CREATIVE-MINDED SOFTWARE DEVELOPER in training at Masterschool, specializing in AI and software engineering. With an M.A. in Journalism and a decade-long background in music, photography, and visual storytelling, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, creativity, and curiosity to everything I do.

After years on the road as a tour manager and photographer—coordinating global tours and capturing stories through a lens—I embraced the shift brought by the pandemic as an opportunity to go deeper into creative work. As AI emerged in creative workflows, my curiosity in tech grew naturally. This led me to pursue a full-time training in Software Engineering with a specialisation in AI, focusing on developing and deploying AI-driven applications.

Skills I’m building amongst others:

🐍 Python

💻 Web Development (HTML, CSS, Flask)

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📊 Databases & SQL

🤖 OpenAI API & LangChain

⚡ FastAPI & Streamlit

🤖 HuggingFace tools

------------------------------------------------------

💡 On this journey, I rediscovered something powerful:

A NEW SPARK FOR CREATIVITY—THIS TIME THROUGH CODE.

------------------------------------------------------

What drives me:

🎯 Merging creative + technical skills to build human-centered, meaningful tools

🎯 Lifelong learning with a growth mindset (and a love for making mistakes!)

🎯 Creating, connecting, and contributing with purpose and independence

Empowering myself through mindfulness, climbing and the creative process.
Intuition is your ally. No growth in the comfort zone.
